# 🎓 Student Performance Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
*Role:* Data Analyst | *Domain:* Education / EdTech  
*Goal:* To analyze the impact of study habits, attendance, and parental education on student final grades using statistical regression.

## 💼 Business Problem
An educational institution wanted to identify "at-risk" students early in the semester. They needed to understand which factors (e.g., Attendance vs. Study Hours) were the strongest predictors of failure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* *Language:* Python
* *Libraries:* Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
* *Statistics:* Correlation Analysis, Linear Regression

## 🔍 Key Insights
1.  *Attendance Matters Most:* Attendance had a *0.8 correlation* with final grades. Students with <75% attendance were 3x more likely to fail.
2.  *Study Hours Paradox:* High study hours (>10/week) only improved grades if attendance was also high.
3.  *Parental Impact:* Students whose parents had higher education levels tended to have a 15% higher average score, suggesting a need for better support systems for first-generation learners.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* analysis.py: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization.
* prediction_model.py: Linear Regression model to predict Final Grade (G3).
