Student Performance Trends Analysis
Project Overview
Role: Data Analyst | Domain: Education / EdTech Goal: To analyze the impact of study habits, attendance, and parental education on student final grades using statistical regression.

Business Problem
An educational institution wanted to identify "at-risk" students early in the semester. They needed to understand which factors (e.g., Attendance vs. Study Hours) were the strongest predictors of failure.

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

Statistics: Correlation Analysis, Linear Regression

Key Insights
Attendance Matters Most: Attendance had a 0.8 correlation with final grades. Students with <75% attendance were 3x more likely to fail.

Study Hours Paradox: High study hours (>10/week) only improved grades if attendance was also high.

Parental Impact: Students whose parents had higher education levels tended to have a 15% higher average score, suggesting a need for better support systems for first-generation learners.
